-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        - For this project, the color palette was created with the help of [Coolors](https://coolors.co/885db1-c4a6e2-1f1f1f-ffffff-f5f5f5).
        - I specifically aimed for shades of Purple as the main colors due it being frequently assossiated with knowledge, imagination and wisdom, which are desired attributes for this brand.
        - White, whitesmoke and Eerie black were used to improve the readability of the page - these are also very common colors among tech projects.<br>

    -   #### Typography
        - To make the logo, instead of using an Image as usual, I opted for an actual font - this would make resizing and working with the logo in general much easier.
        - Logo font is [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito), from Google Fonts. This is an easy to read font and while the conventional choice would be a "serif" type font for the logo, I opted for a modern and joyous-looking one to make people aware that this is an innovative project.
        - All remaining content is presented using [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text=I%20love%20reading!&preview.text_type=custom) - Also from Google, that as described by [justinmind.com](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/best-google-web-fonts-website/), is an "attractive, geometric sans-serif font for use in text or display contexts"
    -   #### Imagery
        - The App Mockups were created by myself using [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/photoshop.html?sdid=88X75SKS&mv=search&ef_id=CjwKCAiAzNj9BRBDEiwAPsL0d5iteD9mDfwbVY5_zxo4G1ioeCjslpMQ38zeDxEL1WdMDsP8enAQSxoCYb8QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!474049279825!e!!g!!photoshop!1423511192!58810496314&gclid=CjwKCAiAzNj9BRBDEiwAPsL0d5iteD9mDfwbVY5_zxo4G1ioeCjslpMQ38zeDxEL1WdMDsP8enAQSxoCYb8QAvD_BwE).
        - Bookdrops App UI was heavily inspired on [Netflix](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&hl=en_IE)'s Android UI as the main goal was to make it look real, something that brought familiarity to the users.
        - To create the App images I used the free iPhone and iPad frames available on [invisionapp.com](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/design-resources/clay-device-mockup-kit/).
        - The icons used in the App UI, as well as the ones used in the Features section were created by [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.local) - these were used as in a way of complementing the message. 
        - As written by [Nijolaj Mertz](https://usabilla.com/blog/how-and-why-icons-improve-you-web-design/#:~:text=Icons%20can%20be%20a%20great,together%20with%20more%20descriptive%20text.) :
